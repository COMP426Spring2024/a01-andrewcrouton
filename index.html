                <h2> The Beginning: Creation according to Pastafarians </h2>
                <p>
                    Members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, known as Pastafarians, worship a central deity, the Flying Spaghetti Monster. According to the Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, "the only dogma allowed in the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the rejection of dogma." Despite this declaration, Pastafarians hold many strong beliefs about the Flying Spaghetti Monster's Role in the creation of Earth.

                    Pastafarians believe that the Flying Spaghetti Monster, an invisible deity, created the universe "after drinking heavily". Pastafarians attribute the flaws of Earth to the Flying Spaghetti Monster's drunkeness.

                    The Gospel of the Flying Spaghetti Monster details the creation of Earth as taking place over multiple days. On the first day, the Flying Spaghetti Monster seperated light from dark. Next, on the second day, the Flying Spaghetti Monster created land, as He was tired of always flying. On this land, He additionally created a beer volcano. The Flying Spaghetti Monster, in his hedonism, drank too much from the volcano. The next morning, hungover, the Flying Spaghetti Monster evaluated what His divine power had done to Earth in his intoxicated state. He created seas, Heaven, Hell, and inferior beings, which called 'Man' and 'Woman.' Man and Woman lived in harmony in the Garden of Eden, until the Flying Spaghetti Monster caused a great flood during a cooking accident.

                    According to the Gospel, this creation occurred 5000 years ago. Pastafarians believe that all evidence of evolution was merely placed on Earth in an effort by the Flying Spaghetti Monster to test the faith of humans. In response to critics who cite radiocarbon dating as evidence of an Earth older than 5000 years, Pastafarians cite the Gospel, that states any such evidence has been tampered with by "His Noodly Appendage."
